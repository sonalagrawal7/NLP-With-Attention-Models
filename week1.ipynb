    "Here, you will find dedicated mentors who provide academic support for this course. They do this by answering questions, explaining concepts, giving feedback, and sharing resources in the course forums. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Please feel free to ask questions and interact with mentors on the forums.\n",
    "* As a reminder, the Coursera Honor Code states that you should not share your solutions to homeworks, quizzes, etc. So, please do not post any code on the forums.\n",
    "* Please search for your question in forums before writing a new one. It may be answered already.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slack\n",
    "The slack channel is a community for learners to meet other learners from around the world, ask questions, discuss ideas and work together.\n",
    "You can pair up with learners that have similar interests. For example paper discussions, kaggle competitions, hackathons, share opportunities etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will learn about opportunities to work more directly with deeplearning.ai as mentors. \n",

    "Recurrent models typically take in a sequence in the order it is written and use that to output a sequence. Each element in the sequence is associated with its step in computation time tt. (i.e. if a word is in the third element, it will be computed at $t_3$. These models generate a sequence of hidden states $h_t$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t−1}$ and the input for position t. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential nature of models you learned in the previous course (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) does not allow for parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. In other words, if you rely on sequences and you need to know the beginning of a text before being able to compute something about the ending of it, then you can not use parallel computing. You would have to wait until the initial computations are complete. This is not good, because if your text is too long, then 1) it will take a long time for you to process it and 2) you will lose a good amount of information mentioned earlier in the text as you approach the end.  \n",

    "Therefore, attention mechanisms have become critical  for sequence modeling in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without caring too much about their distance in the input or output sequences. \n",
